PREREQUISITES:
- install node and npm (http://nodejs.org/download/)
- sudo npm install -g mocha chai webdriverjs (Can't use sudo in Windows, can't you?)
- export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules/" (maybe a different location under Windows)
- run mocha in the directory where the src and test folders live
